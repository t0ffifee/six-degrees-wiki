# six-degrees-wiki

breadth first search algorithm that traverses through the first 6 links of an article to a maximum depth of 6 to find the shortest path between two wiki articles (no idea if this will work yet)

## rules
 - no overview articles like: "List of", "Category:"
 - no '(disambiguation)' articles
